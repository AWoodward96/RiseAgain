# This isn't necessary right now, but I'm making it anyway
# I'm currently tesing the demikestrel, so when I go to implement Ice Wall this could be a thing that gets
# implemented as a preview thing, but right now the player doesn't have any skills to summon grid entiteis, so no preview is necessary
